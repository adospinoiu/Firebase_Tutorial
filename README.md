# Firebase_Tutorial

#1 Created a new Repo on GitHub with the included README file. 

#2 Created a file on my computer to hold the project.

#3 Cloned from my local file (on my computer) to the GitHub Repo by using 'git clone' and the link provided on the GitHub page.

#4 reate the REACT APP with the installation line "npx create-react-app firebase-tutorial-front-end". The last part of the installation line is actually the name of the folder that will be created where the React Install files will be.

#5 Delete the un-necessary files installed by the React Installation: App.test.js; logo.svg and setupTests.js. Remove the 'import logo' from App.js

#6 Made two simple entry fields (email and password) that have a listener tied to a button. When the button is clicked, it stores the information in the entry fields as an object

#7 Need to install Firebase next
